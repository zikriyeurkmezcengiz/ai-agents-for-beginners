    "In today's fast-paced world, planning a business trip involves more than just booking a flight and a hotel room. It requires a level of coordination and efficiency that can be challenging to achieve. This is where Multi-AI Agents come into play, revolutionizing the way we manage our travel needs.\n",

When planning a business trip, we need to consult with a business travel agent to obtain air ticket information, hotel information, etc. Through AI Agents, we can build agents for booking services and agents for itinerary arrangement to collaborate and improve the level of intelligence. \n"
